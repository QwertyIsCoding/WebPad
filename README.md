# WebPad
A very basic web-based notepad! Has annotations in the code so that even a beginner can see, understand and use it!

This application does not REMEMBER your data if you close your tab or window. But, if you refresh it SHOULD remember your notes. It is just to keep your windows organised so you can have everything in one place and prevents you from switching windows.

This application is still in it's early stages and will be updated sooner or later. Please feel free to inform me about bugs or errors that you come across.
